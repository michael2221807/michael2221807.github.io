	<h1>Planning</h1>
	<p class="project-body">
		The pokemon trainer is a interactive web application that allow players to own and grow their pokemons. Every player would start with Pikachu and by playing with him, you would grant credit which can be used to purchase more pokemon. The pokemons would evolve when they reach the designed level, and will produce more credit. The frontend of the app would be build with React and Material-ui, and the backend would be built with NodeJS with express. The server would connect to the database and provide APIs for the frontend. JSON format would be used for database modeling and MongoDB would be selected.
	</p>
	<h1>Design and Development</h1>
	<p>
		<br>Here is a brief demostration of the web application after login. There is also a Admin panel which can edit profile for each user and their pokemon.

		<br>Notice: Due to Heroku mLab MongoDB service discontinued on November 10, 2020, the database of our application is removed. Therefore, the website is now out of service until I fix the database issue.
