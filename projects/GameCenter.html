	<h1>Planning</h1>
	<p class="project-body">
		The GameCenter is a android mini games launcher with its own user profile and scoreboard. It consists of three games, Sliding Tiles, Connect 4, and Mine Sweeper. Each of these games implemented with game saver and loader, and each of them has multiple difficulty levels for choosing. Both personal and overall scores are saved and will be listed if you are up on the rank. This is a very light weight project and the main goal of it is to learn Java and Android applications development while put SOLID principle into effect and practice different design patterns.
	</p>
	<p>
	This game was built by me and a team of 4 other people, all having different roles in the development process. I was responsible for the implementation of the sliding tiles, connect 4 and the data serialization (saving and loading), along with most of the unit tests.

	<h1>Design and Development</h1>
	<p>
		<br>- User accounts are managed by the AccounManager, and the AccountManager serializes user data including username, password with HashMap. The AccounManager can create new user, verify login and return the user.

		<br>- The ScoreBoardManager is responsible for saving new player scores if it is on the rank. Both personal and overall scores can be return by the ScoreBoardManager.
		<br> <img src="gamecenter/scoreboard.gif" class="project-image-margin">
		<br>- The Sliding Tiles uses gridviews to display every tiles and interprets which tiles to switch by user click location. Also a stack is used to store previous states for undo function. Used advanced randomization logic to prevent dead board (boards that can impossibly be sloved).
		<br> <img src="gamecenter/slidingtiles.gif" class="project-image-margin">
		<br>- Matrices are used to generate game board, and on every click the game will recursively check the adjacent location, if those locations are safe it will reveal them. Long clicking on tiles will mark them as mine locations. We provide different board sizes for different difficulties.
		<br> <img src="gamecenter/minesweeper.gif" class="project-image-margin">
		<br>- Used similar gridviews strategy to slidingtiles, however, we implement a computer agent for player to play against with. The beginner difficulty has very basic logic -- select from all available moves randomly. The indeterminate difficulty check if the further moves would lead to a win or loss, and make predictions based on the score generated for each available move. (It is still a very basic agent, however, a decision tree or Minimax with alpha-beta pruning would be more ideal).
		<br> <img src="gamecenter/connect4.gif" class="project-image-margin">
		<br>- The personal highest and overall highest scores are saved in the scoreboard. Users can also logout from the game center.
