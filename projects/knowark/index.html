	<h1>Planning</h1>
	<p>
		We are planning to build a mobile friendly website where organizations can share the resources to caregivers of kids with physical and intellectual disabilities or anyone who needs the help. In this special period of COVID, most parents with children with special needs have a very tough time finding resources or supports that fits the specific needs for their children. Our platform encourages organizations or anyone who is willing to provide resources, lessons or events to post the activity. Once the post is approved, any caregivers who find it useful can register to attend it. Caregivers can also search with keywords on our website and any relevant event that is not expired will show up. Meanwhile, we are going to ensure the information security of our website since information like age, location, type of disability are sensitive to the caregivers. In short, our website aims at building the connection between the kids and the resources.
	</p>
	<h1>Targets</h1>
	<p>Our website will mainly have two types of target users:
		<br>- The first type is consists of organizations or individuals who are willing to arrange events or to give out some resources.

		<br>- The second type is consists of parents or caregivers of children who are looking for resources and help. 
	</p>
	<h1>Design and Development</h1>
	<p>
		<br>- The frontend technology that we will use would be ReactJS and Material UI. The backend technology we will use would be express framework with dynamodb as our database. Infrastructure we choose AWS from amazon, we will use EC2 for our server, and S3 as our frontend storage. Also we will utilize elastic search to implement our search engine as well as other functionalities.
		<br>- All the code are first commit to github repo and after being checked and built it would be deployed on to Elastic Beanstalk by a CI/CD pipeline.
		<br>- Imporvemnets on searching service including UI upgrade and Elasticsearch implementation.
		<br>- Re-classify the database with password encryption, and implement password auto-expiration and reset logic.
		<br>- Set up HTTPS protocol for the website with SSL certificate, set up auto-scaling and metrics to monitor the traffics.
	</p>
